Figure~\ref{fig:resids} shows how the residuals of each model are correlated with each other.
All pairs of models show a positive correlation between each other.
This suggests that poor predictions made by one model were also made by most other models, qualitatively speaking.
This observation is consistent with the finding that the accuracy of all models in this study were comparable.
No single model was substantially better at predicting the outlying points than any other model.

    \caption{Corner plot of the residuals of all models.
        Each subfigure shows the parity between the residuals of pairs of models.
        Solid contour lines delineate quartiles of the point distribution.
        Single, faded points indicate parity points in the fourth, least dense quartile of points.
        Shaded pixels indicate the highest density of points with darker shading indicating a higher density.
        The figures along the diagonal show histogram distributions of the residuals for each model.
        All units are in eV.

Figure~\ref{fig:stdevs} shows how the predicted uncertainties of each model are correlated with each other.
The only pattern we could discern was the correlation between the GP and GP$_{NN-\mu}$ methods.
This correlation likely due to the fact that both methods used the same exact feature space for their GPs.
The only difference between the two were their mean functions.
